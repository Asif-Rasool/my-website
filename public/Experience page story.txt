# **My Work Life in Stories**

If I had to describe my career so far, I would say it feels like walking through different neighborhoods of the same city. Each place had its own pace, its own noise, and its own lessons. None of them looked alike, but each one taught me something I still carry with me.

My professional life began in Dhaka’s banking world, a place that never really sleeps. At Standard Chartered Bank, I felt like a mechanic inside a busy workshop. I spent my days studying how financial products worked, talking to customers, collecting their thoughts through surveys and focus groups, and trying to design better solutions. It was my first lesson in understanding that behind every financial product there is a human story. Someone is trying to solve a problem. Someone is planning for a dream. Someone simply wants a little more security. 

From there, I stepped into Eastern Bank Limited. The pace quickened, and the air felt heavier with responsibility. Working in corporate banking felt like learning to drive on a crowded road. There were deadlines racing toward me, clients waiting with questions, and proposals that had to be refined until they were clear and convincing. I built financial models the way a craftsman shapes metal, slowly and with care. Cash flow statements, credit assessments, risk evaluations, and long hours of preparation became part of my rhythm. In those years, I learned how to stay calm when the pressure grew and how to find clarity when everything around me felt loud. 

A few years later, my story shifted into research. At Utah State University and then at Penn State, I found myself in a quieter world. Research felt like walking through a deep forest where every tree held a question. Data became the landscape, wide and sometimes confusing. I learned to carve insights out of that landscape with patience and curiosity. Some days the numbers cooperated. Other days they refused to make sense. Little by little, I learned how to think slowly and carefully, and how to trust the long process of discovery. Those years changed the way I approach every problem in my work today. 

Then the story leaped to the high desert of New Mexico. As a Senior Economist for the state, my work suddenly carried real weight. Forecasting revenue streams felt like steering a ship through unpredictable weather. Markets shifted like moving clouds. Policy decisions depended on how well the models could anticipate the next season. I built forecasting systems, automated complex processes, evaluated state bond proposals, and contributed to major reports. I also created Alphie, the first AI assistant for state employees, which opened the door to new ideas about how technology can help public service. It was a chapter filled with responsibility and problem solving, and it reshaped my understanding of how government works behind the scenes. 

Now I am at the Business Research Center at Southeastern Louisiana University. This chapter feels like a place where all the earlier paths meet. My role as a Research Scientist lets me build economic impact studies, forecasting models, AI systems, and interactive tools that help communities understand their own data. Some days I am building dashboards. Some days I am presenting research to local leaders. Some days I am teaching students who remind me of my younger self. Beneath all of this is something simple. My work is about taking something complex and turning it into something clear and useful. It is a kind of translation between the world of research and the world of everyday decisions. 

When I look at my career, it does not feel like climbing a ladder. It feels like following a river that flows through different landscapes. The early rush of banking, the thoughtful calm of research, the weight of public service, and the creative energy of building tools for real people have all been part of the journey.

The river is still moving. I am still learning, still exploring new directions, and still curious about the chapters that have not yet been written.
