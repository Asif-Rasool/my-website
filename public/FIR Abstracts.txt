Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Registration Fees: Fiscal and Policy Implications for New Mexico

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report evaluates the revenue, administrative, and policy implications of Senate Bill 183, which establishes new annual registration fees for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in New Mexico. Using historical trends from 2016–2022, the analysis projects sustained growth in EV adoption—averaging 57% annually, substantially higher than the national rate—as well as continued expansion of the PHEV market. The report models revenue effects through FY2028 by combining projected market growth, vehicle fleet composition, and statutory fee schedules. The proposed fees are estimated to generate increasing annual revenue for the Motor Vehicle Suspense Fund, State Road Fund, and Transportation Project Fund, while offsetting declining gasoline-tax receipts. The analysis also examines policy trade-offs, including potential disincentives for EV adoption and conflicts between SB 183 and the clean-vehicle definitions established in HB 140. Administrative impacts include significant information-technology modification costs and new reporting requirements. Overall, the bill provides a near-term mechanism for stabilizing road-fund revenues in a transitioning vehicle market but raises important considerations regarding climate objectives, tax-credit interactions, and definitional consistency across statutes.

Corporate Income Tax Liability: Restoring Subpart F Income and Revising the Water’s-Edge Group Definition

Asif Rasool and Lucinda Sydow, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report examines Senate Bill 181, which proposes two significant amendments to New Mexico’s Corporate Income Tax (CIT) structure: reinstating Subpart F income into the state corporate tax base and modifying the definition of the “water’s-edge group” to include all U.S.-organized corporations within a unitary group, regardless of the proportion of property, payroll, or sales sourced to the United States. Using CIT return data from fiscal years 2021–2023, the analysis estimates that these changes will generate an additional $1.0 to $1.7 million in recurring General Fund revenue beginning in FY2026, with subsequent annual revenue gains reflecting projected gross CIT growth. The report situates Subpart F within its federal policy origins—established to limit income deferral by controlled foreign corporations—and explains why reintroducing it into New Mexico’s base income aligns with federal conformity and long-standing tax policy principles. The proposed revision to water’s-edge reporting strengthens conformity with federal sourcing rules and case law governing taxation of multinational corporate groups, ensuring that U.S.-organized corporations cannot avoid inclusion in combined reporting solely through foreign apportionment. The analysis identifies no technical issues, notes that Section 250 clarification will resolve ongoing taxpayer inquiries, and anticipates routine administrative adjustments to information systems, forms, and publications as part of annual tax year updates.

Solar Market Development Tax Credit Changes: Fiscal Implications and Equity Considerations

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report evaluates Senate Bill 121, which expands eligibility for New Mexico’s Solar Market Development Income Tax Credit and substantially increases the program’s annual certification cap. The bill corrects a structural oversight by allowing taxpayers who lease residences, businesses, or agricultural properties owned by federally recognized tribes to claim the credit, thereby improving horizontal equity. SB 121 also authorizes an additional $20 million in retroactive credits for tax years 2020–2023 to compensate taxpayers who were unable to claim the credit after the statutory $12 million cap was reached, and increases the annual cap to $30 million for tax years 2024–2031. Drawing on national trends—such as the solar industry’s 24% average annual growth rate and rapid expansion in residential installations—the analysis projects that demand for New Mexico’s credit will continue to exceed the prior cap. The resulting fiscal impact is estimated as the difference between the old and new caps, producing recurring annual General Fund revenue reductions beginning in FY2025. The report discusses broader policy considerations, including trade-offs between tax equity, environmental benefits, and economic development, as well as administrative challenges related to timing of 2023 filings and certificate processing. Technical clarification is recommended to avoid ambiguity regarding the one-time $20 million retroactive allocation. Implementation will require routine updates to information systems and taxpayer guidance as part of annual tax-year changes.

Comprehensive Tax Restructuring in New Mexico: Revenue, Equity, and Administrative Implications of SB-105

Lucinda Sydow, Pedro Clavijo, Sara Grubbs, and Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report analyzes Senate Bill 105, an omnibus tax reform measure that substantially restructures New Mexico’s tax system by revising rate structures, repealing multiple tax programs, and broadening the gross receipts and income tax bases. The bill lowers statutory rates for personal and corporate income taxes, gross receipts tax (GRT), compensating tax, governmental GRT, and leased-vehicle GRT, while simultaneously repealing or sunsetting a large set of deductions, exemptions, and credits—including the rural job, investment, technology jobs and research, high-wage jobs, and various energy and housing credits—and phasing out the film production tax credit. It also repeals entire tax acts such as the Estate Tax Act, Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Act, Alternative Fuel Tax Act, County and Municipal Gasoline Tax Act, and Insurance Premium Tax Act, introduces additional registration fees for electric vehicles, creates a GRT exemption for donations to nonprofits, and eliminates certain state GRT distributions and tax-increment mechanisms for local development. Using administrative tax-return data, the Tax Expenditure Report, and macroeconomic forecasts from the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group and the University of New Mexico BBER, the report models section-level revenue impacts but does not produce a comprehensive net estimate due to complex interactions among rate reductions, base broadening, and distributional changes. Methodology includes microsimulation of new PIT and CIT brackets, estimation of GRT and compensating tax losses at a 2 percent state rate, and incorporation of dynamic demand projections for electric vehicles in estimating additional registration-fee revenue. The policy discussion highlights potential gains in tax simplicity, neutrality, and base uniformity, alongside risks of reduced progressivity in the PIT, abrupt withdrawal of long-standing economic-development incentives, and major shifts in revenue streams for both the General Fund and local governments. The report concludes that the scope and complexity of SB-105 would require phased implementation, extensive systems changes to GenTax and related platforms, significant contractual and staffing costs, and a longer lead time than the bill’s proposed effective dates to avoid administrative disruption and fiscal uncertainty.

Severance Tax Exemption for Production Compliance Projects: Fiscal, Equity, and Administrative Implications

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report evaluates Senate Bill 64, which creates a new severance tax exemption for natural gas, oil, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from stripper well properties that undergo an approved production compliance project. The exemption applies for up to ten years following project completion—or until the foregone severance tax equals the verified cost of the compliance project—and is contingent upon certification by the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) and subsequent approval by the Taxation and Revenue Department. Using U.S. Energy Information Administration data on vented and flared natural gas, alongside production growth forecasts from the December 2023 Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, the analysis estimates recurring annual revenue reductions of $3.9–$4.5 million to the Severance Tax Permanent Fund beginning in FY2025, with additional reductions in General Fund interest earnings due to diminished corpus growth. The report highlights uncertainty regarding which wells will qualify as production compliance projects, requiring assumptions that qualifying volumes grow in line with statewide natural gas production. Policy considerations focus on the precedent of subsidizing regulatory compliance costs through tax expenditures, raising concerns about horizontal equity and potential cross-industry inconsistencies. Technical issues include statutory clarification of “stripper well property” and specification of where verifiable cost documentation must be submitted. Implementation poses substantial administrative challenges, requiring approximately 2,100 hours of IT development, new exemption-tracking systems, and interfaces with EMNRD, suggesting that the effective date should be extended to July 1, 2025, to avoid operational disruption.

Rail Infrastructure Income Tax Credit: Incentive Design, Fiscal Cost, and Administrative Feasibility

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report analyzes Senate Bill 28, which creates a Rail Infrastructure Income Tax Credit under both the Personal Income Tax Act and the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act for taxpayers that are railroads. The credit equals 50 percent of qualified reconstruction, replacement, or new rail infrastructure expenditures, subject to annual certification by the Department of Transportation (DOT), with total certifications capped at $6 million per calendar year and a $5 million sub-cap for new infrastructure. Using information on ongoing rail projects in New Mexico—including modernization of the Belen Yard, double-tracking on key freight corridors, and routine infrastructure upgrades—the analysis assumes that major rail carriers will capture most or all of the available cap, yielding an estimated recurring General Fund revenue loss between $3 million and $6 million per year. The report concludes that, given the scale and profitability of the rail sector, the credit is unlikely to be a decisive driver of investment and instead functions as a subsidy for activity that would largely occur absent the incentive, thereby narrowing the tax base and adding complexity to the tax system. Policy discussion highlights concerns about horizontal equity, proliferation of industry-specific credits, and the importance of sunset dates to reassess tax expenditures. Numerous technical issues are identified, including ambiguities around eligible “taxpayers that are railroads,” coordination of certification and application timelines, alignment of annual caps, and the division of responsibilities between DOT and the Taxation and Revenue Department. The report recommends simplifying the administration by having DOT manage the cap and transmit certificates directly to Tax & Rev, clarifying key definitions, and authorizing DOT rulemaking. Implementation is expected to have a modest administrative impact, requiring approximately 300 hours of IT work and limited additional staff time, incorporated into annual tax-year systems changes.

Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Distributions: Revenue Reallocation and Budgetary Implications

Asif Rasool and Lucinda Sydow, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report evaluates Senate Bill 184, which revises the statutory distribution of Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (MVEX) revenue by reallocating all proceeds to transportation-related funds. The bill replaces the current allocation—59.39 percent to the General Fund, 21.86 percent to the State Road Fund, and 18.75 percent to the Transportation Project Fund—with a new formula directing 75 percent of MVEX receipts to the State Road Fund and 25 percent to the Transportation Project Fund. Applying the proposed distribution ratios to the December 2023 Consensus Revenue Estimating Group (CREG) MVEX forecast, the analysis estimates a recurring annual reduction of $166–183 million to the General Fund, offset by corresponding increases to state and local transportation funds. The report notes that while dedicating MVEX revenues to road infrastructure aligns tax collections with the costs generated by vehicle use and supports long-term transportation planning, it simultaneously removes a stable revenue source from the General Fund, diminishing legislative flexibility and reducing resources available for broad public services. Administrative impacts are minimal, limited to updates to the Tapestry general ledger and information-system modifications requiring approximately 300 combined hours of staff time across ASD and ITD. No technical or legal issues are identified. Overall, SB 184 enhances transportation funding stability but introduces material General Fund exposure that must be weighed against competing statewide fiscal priorities.

Advanced Energy Equipment Income Tax Credit: Manufacturing Incentives, Fiscal Exposure, and Alignment with Federal Clean-Energy Policy

Asif Rasool and Lucinda Sydow, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report analyzes House Bill 274, which establishes the Advanced Energy Equipment Income Tax Credit for manufacturers of components eligible for the federal Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. The state credit—available from tax year 2025 through 2032—provides the lesser of 20 percent of qualified expenditures or $25 million per project, subject to pre-certification and final certification by the Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD). The bill permits transferability of credits, a five-year carryforward, and imposes recapture provisions should a taxpayer cease operations within two years of claiming the credit. Using publicly disclosed investment plans from Arcosa, Hota Industrial Manufacturing, and Maxeon Solar Technologies, the analysis assumes one major certification per year beginning in 2025, with fiscal impacts beginning in FY2027. These projects alone are expected to generate recurring General Fund revenue reductions of roughly $15 million in FY2027 and $25 million in FY2028, with additional exposure as more suppliers and manufacturers become eligible.

The report situates the credit within the broader policy landscape, noting that HB 274 complements federal IRA incentives and advances the climate, energy-transition, and industrial-development goals outlined in Executive Order 2019-003. The credit is expected to support the emergence of advanced energy manufacturing clusters—particularly in wind, solar, battery technologies, and carbon-management systems—while contributing to job creation and long-term diversification of New Mexico’s energy-dependent economy. Nevertheless, the bill raises several technical concerns, including ambiguities in application timelines, carryforward rules extending beyond the statutory repeal date, the need for clearer reporting requirements to enforce recapture, and clarification of “qualified expenditures” relative to preliminary certification. Administrative impacts are significant: implementation requires approximately 1,140 hours of IT development, new EMNRD–Taxation and Revenue data interfaces, updated forms and processing workflows, and cross-agency oversight of transfers and recapture. Overall, HB 274 represents a major targeted incentive aligned with federal clean-energy policy, but introduces substantial fiscal risk and administrative complexity requiring statutory refinement.

Adjusting Income Tax Brackets and Related Tax Code Changes in New Mexico: Distributional, Fiscal, and Administrative Effects

Pedro Clavijo, Sara Grubbs, Asif Rasool, and Lucinda Sydow, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report analyzes the House Taxation and Revenue Committee Substitute for House Bill 252. The bill is an omnibus tax package that modifies personal income tax brackets, expands or adjusts several existing tax credits, creates new deductions, and restructures corporate income tax apportionment. It also extends the Angel Investment Credit, broadens the Rural Health Care Practitioner Credit, creates a Home Fire Recovery Income Tax Credit, and applies single sales factor apportionment and a flat 5.9 percent corporate income tax rate beginning in tax year 2025. The bill further provides new gross receipts tax deductions for environmental modification services for Medicaid recipients and for child care assistance and pre-kindergarten services, and it expands the Industrial Revenue Bond statutes to include qualifying energy storage facilities.

Using personal and corporate income tax return data, New Mexico’s BBER economic forecast, and the December 2023 Consensus Revenue Estimating Group projections, the analysis estimates a General Fund revenue reduction of approximately 160 million dollars by FY2026 from revised personal income tax brackets. Additional recurring annual impacts include an 11.6 million dollar reduction from the expanded Rural Health Care Practitioner Credit and a potential reduction of up to 5 million dollars from the Home Fire Recovery Credit. The change to single sales factor apportionment and the flat corporate income tax rate produces a net positive corporate income tax impact due to New Mexico’s position as a consumption-oriented state.

The policy analysis identifies both equity and efficiency considerations. Adjustments to the personal income tax brackets mitigate long-standing bracket creep and modestly improve vertical equity for low and middle income taxpayers. Expansion of the Rural Health Care Practitioner Credit reduces horizontal equity but aims to address severe shortages of medical personnel in rural areas. Capital gains deduction changes reduce benefits for high-income taxpayers with large business-related gains. The shift to single sales factor apportionment reduces complexity but may shift tax liability away from in-state firms that make significant use of public infrastructure.

Administrative impacts are substantial due to the wide scope of the bill. The Taxation and Revenue Department estimates approximately 3,060 hours of Information Technology Division work, along with significant system testing, form and instruction updates, new reporting interfaces with the Department of Health, and additional processing workload for the new Home Fire Recovery Credit. Total nonrecurring IT and administrative costs exceed 170,000 dollars, and one new FTE will be required for ongoing credit administration.

Transportation Trust Fund and Revised Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Distributions: Fiscal Effects and Budgetary Tradeoffs

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report examines House Bill 146, as amended by the House Transportation, Public Works and Capital Improvements Committee. The bill creates a new Transportation Trust Fund and redirects several existing revenue streams to support long term transportation infrastructure planning. It allocates one percent of taxable gross receipts from electricity sales to the new fund, transfers unused capital outlay balances, and revises the distribution of Motor Vehicle Excise Tax revenue. Before July 1, 2026, MVEX revenue is redistributed among the General Fund, the State Road Fund, the Transportation Project Fund, and the new fund. After July 1, 2026, the share for the State Road Fund and the Transportation Trust Fund increases. The amendment adopted by HTPWC requires that transfers from the Transportation Trust Fund to the State Road Fund beginning in FY2028 be used only as state matching dollars for federal transportation grants. The bill also introduces a contingency formula between FY2029 and FY2040 under which a significant decline in statewide gross receipts tax revenue triggers a temporary reallocation of MVEX distributions.

Using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the December 2023 Consensus Revenue Estimating Group forecast, the analysis estimates recurring annual General Fund revenue reductions of more than 100 million dollars beginning in FY2026 due to revised MVEX distributions. Corresponding increases accrue to the State Road Fund, the Transportation Project Fund, and the Transportation Trust Fund. The bill also shifts approximately 20 million dollars of GRT revenue from the General Fund to the new fund beginning in FY2025. Policy considerations focus on the substantial loss of General Fund flexibility, since MVEX contributed 164.7 million dollars to the General Fund in FY2023, and on the increased complexity of revenue distributions within the tax code. The report notes that while earmarking may strengthen long term transportation planning, it also constrains the legislature’s ability to meet statewide priorities in future years.

Implementation requires the Taxation and Revenue Department to modify the GenTax and Tapestry systems to establish new distribution formulas and accounting structures. The Administrative Services Division estimates 260 hours of work to build and test new ledger functions, and the Information Technology Division estimates 650 hours to implement new GRT and MVEX distribution logic. Total nonrecurring costs are approximately 47,000 dollars. The report identifies a key technical concern: current GRT reporting does not distinguish electricity sales from other receipts, which limits the department’s ability to implement the one percent earmark without statutory changes.

Clean Car Income Tax Credits: Market Growth, Revenue Effects, and Administrative Considerations

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report evaluates House Bill 140, which creates four refundable and transferable tax credits to support the adoption of electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, and associated charging infrastructure. The bill establishes a personal and corporate income tax credit for the purchase or new lease of qualifying clean vehicles priced below specified thresholds, along with separate credits for the purchase and installation of residential or commercial charging units. Credits phase down annually from tax year 2024 through 2029, and all credits require certification by the Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department prior to being claimed. Taxpayers may transfer credits at full value, and application deadlines are limited to one year from purchase or lease.

Using historical registration data and market growth rates, the analysis assumes continuation of rapid electric vehicle adoption in New Mexico. Between 2016 and 2022, statewide electric vehicle registrations grew at an average rate of 57 percent per year, significantly outpacing national trends. Plug-in hybrid registrations also increased at an average rate of 38 percent. Based on these trends and on assumptions that New Mexico remains in an early stage of market development, the analysis projects clean vehicles to reach approximately 7 percent of all registered vehicles by 2028. Charging-unit credit impacts are modeled using national market data indicating strong expansion in direct-current fast charging infrastructure and sustained consumer demand for home charging equipment. Aggregating these estimates, the bill is projected to reduce recurring General Fund revenue by 27 million dollars in FY2024, 41 million dollars in FY2025, and 45 million dollars annually in FY2026 through FY2028.

The report situates the credits within the state’s climate and energy policy framework, noting alignment with Executive Order 2019-003, which directs state agencies to advance greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy deployment, and transportation electrification. By lowering the cost of vehicle purchases and charging installation, HB 140 supports these statewide objectives and may accelerate the transition away from internal combustion vehicles. Administrative impacts are significant due to high expected application volumes, transferability features, and the need for cross-agency coordination with EMNRD. Implementation requires approximately 1,400 hours of IT development, 308,000 dollars in contractual support, and 12,000 dollars in administrative testing and staff workload. No technical issues are identified in the bill language.

Electric Generation Tax Sunset Removal: Corporate Apportionment, Revenue Risk, and Investment Incentives

Asif Rasool and Lucinda Sydow, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report analyzes House Bill 118, which removes the sunset on the single sales factor apportionment election for taxpayers that receive income from certain electricity generation facilities under Section 7-4-10(E) NMSA 1978. Current law limits this election to tax years ending on or before 2023, after which qualifying generators would revert to three-factor apportionment based on property, payroll, and sales. HB 118 makes the single sales factor option permanent for these taxpayers, effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Using recent corporate income tax data, the report estimates that the immediate General Fund revenue impact is less than 500 thousand dollars per year, and notes that the December 2023 Consensus Revenue Estimating Group forecast already assumes continuation of the single sales factor treatment, so there is no mechanical downward adjustment to the official forecast.

The analysis situates HB 118 within the broader expansion of renewable electricity generation in New Mexico. Only a small share of the 37 taxpayers that have elected manufacturing single sales factor in recent years are power generators, but new projects such as Pattern Energy’s Western Spirit Wind complex and planned additions that could bring installed wind capacity to more than 8,300 megawatts are expected to increase the number and scale of eligible taxpayers. As more generation is exported under long-term power purchase agreements with out-of-state utilities, single sales factor apportionment will tend to lower New Mexico corporate income tax liability relative to a three-factor formula. The report concludes that while HB 118 supports continued investment in large renewable projects and reinforces New Mexico’s position as an energy exporter, it also preserves the erosion of horizontal equity among corporate taxpayers, since similarly situated firms that do not qualify for the election must continue to apportion income using all three factors. Administrative impacts are minimal and limited to routine updates to forms, instructions, and publications as part of annual tax-year changes.

Geothermal Electricity Generation Tax Credits: Incentive Design, Fiscal Exposure, and Administrative Complexity

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report examines House Bill 92, which establishes new personal and corporate income tax credits for electricity generated by geothermal facilities and creates new gross receipts and compensating tax deductions for equipment and construction related to geothermal electricity production. The bill also provides hold harmless distributions to counties and municipalities to offset local revenue losses resulting from the new deductions. The income tax credit is equal to 0.015 dollars per kilowatt-hour of geothermal electricity produced in New Mexico, subject to a five million dollar annual cap and a three-year carryforward. The six new gross receipts and compensating tax deductions apply to equipment, construction services, distribution-system components, and construction plant costs associated with geothermal facilities.

Using data on existing geothermal plants in New Mexico and industry growth patterns, the analysis assumes that current facilities will claim the income tax credit and that statewide geothermal capacity will expand in line with national growth of approximately 3 percent annually. New Mexico’s geothermal sector remains small, with around 34 megawatts of installed capacity and 175,000 megawatt-hours of annual generation, so fiscal impacts are modest but recurring. The income tax credits are estimated to reduce General Fund revenue by one to five million dollars per year beginning in FY2025. Additional recurring impacts arise from both the General Fund and local governments due to the new deductions in Section 4, which generate combined losses for the General Fund of roughly 120 to 130 thousand dollars annually and similar effects for local governments, which are offset by the bill’s hold harmless distributions.

The policy analysis notes that geothermal incentives may support early-stage industry development and advance renewable energy goals, but they also add complexity to the tax code and increase compliance burdens for businesses and the department. The bill introduces multiple new GRT and compensating tax distributions, which increases administrative risk and places additional pressure on the GenTax system. Technical concerns identified in the report include ambiguous sourcing language, unclear non-taxable transaction certificate requirements, and the absence of explicit applicability dates for the deductions. Administrative impacts are significant. Implementation requires more than 1,500 hours of IT work, 330,000 dollars in contractual support, 140 hours of distribution-testing work by the Administrative Services Division, and one additional full-time position in the Revenue Processing Division to process certifications and returns.

Energy Storage System Income Tax Credit: Market Development, Fiscal Effects, and Administrative Considerations

Asif Rasool, Taxation and Revenue Department

Abstract

This fiscal impact report evaluates House Bill 73, as amended by the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee. The bill establishes a refundable personal income tax credit for the purchase and installation of energy storage systems on residential, commercial, industrial, or agricultural property in New Mexico. The credit equals 40 percent of eligible costs, up to a maximum of 5,000 dollars for residential systems and 150,000 dollars for commercial, industrial, or agricultural systems. Total certifications are capped at 4 million dollars per calendar year. Taxpayers must obtain eligibility certification from the Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department prior to claiming the credit. The amendment allows EMNRD to issue certifications for the next tax year when the annual cap is reached.

Using industry data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and current New Mexico project activity, the analysis assumes modest initial uptake due to an early stage market. New Mexico has begun to attract large battery storage investments, including the 50 megawatt Buena Vista Energy Center completed in 2023. Based on national trends and expected expansion of storage technology, fiscal impacts are projected at one to four million dollars annually in FY2024 and FY2025, with full use of the four million dollar annual cap beginning in FY2026. All impacts fall on the General Fund due to the refundable nature of the credit.

The policy analysis notes that energy storage supports renewable energy integration and grid reliability, but the credit increases complexity within the tax system and broadens the use of targeted incentives. As more incentives accumulate, compliance burdens increase for taxpayers and for the Taxation and Revenue Department. The credit sunsets after a defined period, which allows for future evaluation of its effectiveness. The report identifies several technical issues, including undefined terms such as residential and commercial property, ambiguous language related to eligible costs, and unclear treatment of multi-family or mixed-use properties.

Administrative impacts include required updates to forms, publications, and processing systems. The Administrative Services Division expects about 40 hours of testing and development time, while the Information Technology Division estimates 300 hours of system modification, included in the annual tax year change cycle. Total nonrecurring administrative costs are approximately 19,600 dollars.
Title
New Mexico 2023 Tax Expenditure Report: Structure, Methodology, and Revenue Implications

Authors
Lucinda Sydow, Pedro Clavijo, Asif Rasool, and Sara Grubbs

Abstract
This report provides a comprehensive measurement and classification of New Mexico’s tax expenditures for fiscal year 2023, defined as deviations from a baseline tax system created by specific statutory provisions that reduce tax liability relative to a neutral tax base. Prepared in accordance with Section 7-1-84 NMSA 1978, the report catalogs 158 tax expenditures in effect for FY2023, including eight newly enacted provisions and fifteen that were repealed during the 2023 legislative session, which will therefore appear here for the final time. Expenditures are grouped into five functional categories, covering citizen benefits, economic development, environment and renewable energy, health care, and highly specialized industry incentives, and are evaluated with respect to both state and local revenue incidence. The analysis relies primarily on taxpayer reported data from the GenTax system, supplemented by administrative records and national data, and assigns a reliability factor to each estimate on a four point scale to convey methodological strength and data limitations. The report also documents statutory authority, legislative history, intended purpose, and, where available, formal evaluations and recommendations for individual provisions. Taken together, these elements make the Tax Expenditure Report a central transparency instrument for comparing forgone revenue to direct appropriations and for informing future reforms of New Mexico’s tax code.
