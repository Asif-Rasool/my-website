**Evaluating the Revenue and Policy Implications of Comprehensive Tax Reform Under New Mexico Senate Bill 105 (2024)**

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report examines the proposed wholesale overhaul of New Mexico’s tax code under SB-105, which would repeal numerous tax acts and credits while simultaneously reducing statutory rates for key taxes such as personal income tax (PIT), corporate income tax (CIT), gross receipts tax (GRT), and compensating tax. The legislation eliminates the Estate Tax Act, Alternative Fuel Tax Act, Insurance Premium Tax Act, rural job tax credits, and several energy and research-related incentives. At the same time, SB-105 compresses the PIT schedule from five brackets to three, reduces GRT and compensating tax rates, lowers the capital gains deduction, and introduces a GRT exemption for nonprofit donations. Using historical return data and forward-looking economic forecasts, the report evaluates the net revenue consequences across major funds. Although repealing credits offsets a portion of the losses, the projected reductions in PIT, CIT, and GRT collections yield substantial net declines. The analysis highlights key trade-offs: reforms aimed at simplicity and uniformity may diminish vertical and horizontal equity and weaken targeted development incentives, while also creating uncertainty for local governments dependent on GRT revenues. The report recommends a phased approach to implementation to allow monitoring of behavioral responses and to provide sufficient time for administrative systems to adapt.

## **Abstract**

HB 0252 is a broad omnibus tax bill that amends multiple aspects of New Mexico’s tax code, including personal income tax (PIT) brackets, corporate income tax (CIT) apportionment and rates, gross receipts tax (GRT) and compensating tax deductions, and several tax-credit and incentive programs. The bill adjusts PIT brackets — expanding income thresholds and modifying marginal rates — to reduce tax burdens for many middle-income households. The bill also enacts “single sales factor” apportionment and sets a flat 5.9 % CIT rate for corporate income tax, eliminating prior property- and payroll-factor calculations. Additionally, HB 0252 revises or extends various tax credits and deductions: it lengthens the period for investments qualifying for the Angel Investment Credit; expands eligibility and relaxes service hour requirements under the Rural Health Care Practitioner Tax Credit (thereby broadening the pool of eligible rural healthcare providers); increases the capital gains deduction standard deduction threshold; creates a “Home Fire Recovery” credit for rebuilding residences lost to wildfires; allows gross receipts deductions for sales of energy storage equipment to governments; provides GRT exemptions for environmental modifications under Medicaid and childcare/pre-kindergarten providers; and incorporates industrial revenue bond eligibility for certain energy storage projects. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Using state tax return data, economic and revenue forecasts, and historical utilization patterns, the report estimates that the combined effect of the provisions yields a net reduction in General Fund revenue beginning in FY 2025 — with an estimated recurring loss of approximately $7.6 million (in thousands) annually, under base-case assumptions. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The report illustrates tradeoffs between tax relief, economic incentives, administrative complexity, and fiscal stability. While the PIT and CIT changes aim to simplify the tax code and relieve burden on households and businesses, the multiple new credits and deductions expand the scope of tax expenditures, potentially eroding the tax base and reducing long-term revenue. The report underscores the necessity of regular monitoring, sunset provisions, and periodic review to assess whether the incentives deliver intended social, economic, or environmental benefits relative to their fiscal cost.

**Assessing the Revenue Effects and Behavioral Incentives of a Proposed Capital Gains Deduction Increase Under New Mexico Senate Bill 64 (2024)**

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report analyzes Senate Bill 64, which proposes increasing New Mexico’s capital gains deduction from 40 percent to 60 percent for qualifying taxpayers. The bill aims to promote investment, savings, and economic activity by lowering the effective tax burden on realized gains. Using historical tax return data and forecasted capital gains realizations, the report estimates the bill’s fiscal consequences for the general fund. The analysis projects material reductions in personal income tax revenue beginning in FY 2025, with the magnitude of losses influenced by volatility in capital gains markets and taxpayer behavior. While the proposed deduction may enhance competitiveness relative to neighboring states and potentially encourage long-term investment, the report highlights important trade-offs: revenue losses are front-loaded, benefits are concentrated among higher-income filers, and the policy significantly reduces vertical equity. The analysis concludes that although SB 64 may generate certain economic incentives, its fiscal costs are substantial and should be weighed against the state’s ongoing budgetary commitments and needs.

## **Title**

**Economic and Fiscal Implications of the Proposed Advanced Energy Equipment Income Tax Credit Under New Mexico House Bill 274 (2024)**

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report evaluates House Bill 274, which proposes creating a new nonrefundable income tax credit for investments in advanced energy manufacturing equipment used in the production of hydrogen, renewable energy technologies, grid modernization components, and related clean-energy systems. The bill establishes a credit equal to 20 percent of qualified equipment costs, capped at $25 million per taxpayer per year, with a statewide annual program limit of $75 million. Using historical industry data, investment trends, and New Mexico’s existing portfolio of energy-related incentives, the analysis estimates the potential revenue impact beginning in FY 2026. Although uptake is uncertain due to taxpayer self-selection and the scale of eligible projects, the report anticipates significant reductions to the general fund as projects ramp up, partially offset by long-run economic development gains. The analysis highlights key considerations related to administrative capacity, verification of equipment eligibility, interaction with federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and the risk of concentrated benefits among large corporate taxpayers. While HB 274 may stimulate high-value capital investment in emerging energy industries, its fiscal cost is substantial, and the report recommends strong oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance, prevent credit stacking, and support evaluation of the program’s long-term economic returns.

**Revenue, Apportionment, and Competitiveness Effects of Corporate Income Tax Restructuring Under New Mexico Senate Bill 181 (2024)**
**Authors:** Asif Rasool and Lucinda Sydow

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report evaluates Senate Bill 181, which proposes major changes to New Mexico’s corporate income tax (CIT) structure, apportionment rules, and multi-state taxation framework. SB 181 consolidates the current three-tier CIT rate schedule into a single rate of 5.9 percent for taxable income above $500,000, repeals the sales-only apportionment election, and eliminates the statewide throwback rule. Using historical corporate tax records and economic forecasting models, the analysis estimates substantial general-fund revenue losses beginning in FY 2025, driven primarily by removing the throwback rule, which currently attributes certain out-of-state sales back to New Mexico. Although the bill is expected to improve tax competitiveness for multi-state firms and reduce compliance burdens associated with apportionment elections and throwback calculations, the report notes significant fiscal risks, including increased exposure to income-shifting and reduced stability of the corporate tax base. The analysis concludes that SB 181 represents a structural shift toward a more nationally aligned CIT system, but its sizeable revenue impact necessitates careful monitoring, particularly given the state’s dependence on CIT revenues from a small number of large corporate taxpayers.

**Fiscal and Infrastructure Funding Effects of Electric- and Plug-in Hybrid-Vehicle Registration Fees Under New Mexico Senate Bill 0183 (2024)**
**Analyst:** New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department (Asif Rasool) ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report assesses the implications of SB 0183, which establishes a new annual registration fee for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) registered in New Mexico. Specifically, the bill sets a $120 annual fee for EVs and a $60 fee for PHEVs (with gross vehicle weight under 26,000 lbs), effective January 1, 2025. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) Based on projected growth trends in New Mexico’s EV/PHEV market, the report estimates that the new fee will generate increasing revenue for the Motor Vehicle Suspense Fund and subsequent allocations to the State Road Fund and Transportation Project Fund across FY 2025 to FY 2028 — rising to an estimated $5.7 million by FY 2028 under base assumptions. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) The analysis assumes continued high year-over-year growth in EV adoption, extrapolating from historical increases between 2016 and 2022. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The report highlights the need for this fee in light of declining gasoline tax revenue — traditionally used to fund road maintenance and infrastructure — as EV usage rises. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) However, the report also flags potential tensions between infrastructure funding goals and environmental/climate-policy incentives: the fee could dampen EV adoption or be seen as counter to clean-energy goals. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) Administrative costs associated with implementing the fee and updating the vehicle registry system are also estimated, with one-time development costs and ongoing staffing/IT resource needs detailed. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Overall, SB 0183 provides a revenue-raising mechanism aimed at preserving transportation infrastructure funding in a vehicle fleet transitioning toward electrification. But the report underscores trade-offs between fiscal stability, administrative burden, and the state’s broader environmental objectives — recommending careful evaluation of EV market growth assumptions and ongoing monitoring of fee effectiveness.

## **Title**

**Expanding Access to the Solar Market Development Income Tax Credit: Fiscal and Equity Implications of New Mexico Senate Bill 121 (2024)**
**Author:** Asif Rasool ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact analysis reviews SB 121, which amends the existing New Solar Market Development Income Tax Credit (NSMD-ITC) under New Mexico law. The bill broadens eligibility to include leased residences, businesses, or agricultural enterprises owned by federally recognized Indian nations, tribes, or pueblos — a correction of prior exclusions for tribal lands. SB 121 also raises the cap on the aggregate amount of credits that may be certified: for calendar years 2020–2023, it allows an additional $20 million in credits to enable retroactive relief for applicants previously excluded by the statutory cap. Beginning in calendar year 2024, the annual certification cap increases from $12 million to $30 million, reflecting growing demand for solar installations. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Using estimates of solar installation costs (residential systems priced between $2.79 and $3.77 per watt, excluding federal incentives), expected payback periods (≈ 10.2 years), and observed growth in solar adoption, the report projects recurring general-fund revenue losses: approximately $2,000 in FY 2024 and $32,100 in FY 2025 (thousands of dollars), followed by an estimated $18,000 loss annually through FY 2028 under base assumptions. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The analysis highlights that while the expanded credit promotes environmental policy objectives, supports increased solar deployment (potentially boosting jobs and clean energy capacity), and enhances horizontal equity by including tribal-owned properties, it also represents a significant long-term tax expenditure. The report raises considerations about the trade-off between environmental and equity goals vs. state fiscal capacity — recommending that deployment progress and uptake rates be monitored closely to assess the sustainability of the program.

**Fiscal Evaluation of the Energy Storage System Income Tax Credit Under New Mexico House Bill 73 (2024)**
**Author:** New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department (Analyst: Asif Rasool) ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report assesses the proposed creation of an “Energy Storage System Income Tax Credit” via HB 73, which would allow taxpayers in New Mexico to claim a credit equal to 40% of the purchase and installation costs of a certified energy storage system on residential, commercial, industrial, or agricultural property. The credit is capped at $5,000 for residential installations and $150,000 for commercial, industrial, or agricultural installations, with a statewide annual cap of $4 million in certified credits. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Under base-case assumptions — reflecting limited but growing adoption of battery storage systems — the report projects small but recurring reductions in general-fund revenue: between $1,000 and $4,000 (in thousands) annually over the first several years. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) The modest fiscal impact reflects the early stage of the storage market and the likelihood that only a limited number of projects will claim the credit under the annual cap. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The analysis identifies several policy and administrative considerations. On the policy side, the credit expands support for clean-energy infrastructure and could catalyze investment in battery storage, enhancing grid resilience and promoting renewable energy integration. On the fiscal side, the proliferation of such tax incentives narrows the tax base and reduces state revenue over time. On the administrative side, implementing the credit would require updates to tax forms, IT systems, and coordination between the tax authority and the agency certifying eligible systems — resulting in one-time administrative costs. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) The report recommends that policymakers consider a sunset provision or regular review to ensure the credit remains fiscally sustainable and aligned with the state’s broader tax and energy policy goals.

**Fiscal and Incentive Effects of the Rail Infrastructure Income Tax Credit Under New Mexico Senate Bill 28 (2024)**
**Author:** Asif Rasool ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report analyzes Senate Bill 28, which establishes a new Rail Infrastructure Income Tax Credit for qualified new rail infrastructure expenditures and reconstruction/replacement expenditures by eligible railroads. Under the proposed law, the credit equals 50% of eligible expenditures, subject to annual certification limits by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (DOT): up to $6 million per calendar year in certifications, with a $5 million cap on credits for new infrastructure expenditures. The credit also applies under the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act. The report projects modest near-term general-fund costs — roughly $3,000 in FY 2025 under base assumptions — recognizing that the high cost and specialized nature of railroad projects make widespread uptake unlikely. The analysis highlights policy and administrative concerns: the complexity of certifying eligible expenditures, the narrow target group (railroad companies), and possible structural issues given that the credit is included under the Personal Income Tax Act despite being aimed at corporate entities. While SB 28 may incentivize maintenance and expansion of rail infrastructure, its fiscal footprint is small; nonetheless, the addition increases complexity in the tax code and raises questions about the consistency of tax-credit placement across tax acts.

**Allocating Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Revenue: Fiscal and Infrastructure Impacts of New Mexico Senate Bill 184 (2024)**
**Authors:** New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department — Analysts: Asif Rasool and Lucinda Sydow ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report analyzes the effects of SB 184, which restructures the distribution of revenues from the state’s Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (MVEX). Under the proposed legislation, 75 % of MVEX proceeds would be allocated to the State Road Fund and 25 % to the Transportation Project Fund (supporting local road projects), replacing the current split that sends ~59.39 % to the General Fund, ~21.86 % to the State Road Fund, and ~18.75 % to the Transportation Project Fund. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Using the December 2023 consensus MVEX revenue forecast, the analysis projects significant recurring shifts: starting FY 2025, the General Fund would lose approximately $166.4 million — growing to roughly $182.7 million by FY 2028. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) Correspondingly, the State Road Fund and Transportation Project Fund would receive substantially increased revenues: ~$148.9 million and ~$17.5 million, respectively, in the first full year after enactment. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The report highlights the policy rationale: redirecting MVEX revenue toward road maintenance and infrastructure aligns tax revenue to road-related expenditures, matching user-fee logic to road wear and construction needs. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) However, it also raises concerns about reduced fiscal flexibility for the General Fund — shrinking the pool of discretionary state resources, which could constrain funding for other statewide priorities. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

On administrative matters, the FIR anticipates modest implementation costs: changes to the state’s accounting system and tax-revenue reporting ledgers would require about 240 hours of IT work and roughly 60 hours of administrative service adjustment, totaling around $13,320 in one-time costs. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

**Long-Term Corporate Tax Implications of Permanently Extending Single-Sales-Factor Apportionment for Electric Generation under HB 118 (2024)**
**Authors:** New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department — Analysts: Asif Rasool & Lucinda Sydow ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report assesses House Bill 118, which proposes to remove the sunset date from the existing statutory provision allowing certain electricity-generation facilities to permanently use a single-sales-factor formula for corporate income tax (CIT) apportionment. Under current law, this preferential apportionment would have expired after taxable year 2023; HB 118 would extend it indefinitely starting January 1, 2024. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The report estimates that in the most recent years (prior to 2024), around 37 taxpayers — including a subset of electricity-generating firms — have elected the manufacturing “single sales factor” option, resulting in an average annual revenue reduction of roughly **US$43 million** across all participating firms. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) For the subset of taxpayers operating under the electricity-generation category, the fiscal impact on the General Fund is modest under baseline assumptions: the report projects losses of **less than US$500,000 annually** (in thousands) for FY 2024–2028. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

While extending the single-sales-factor permanently supports continued investment in large-scale generation projects (including renewable energy installations whose output may be sold largely out-of-state), the report raises two main concerns. First, the policy entrenches a durable tax preference that erodes horizontal equity between corporations that qualify and those that do not, as firms with similar income and activity levels may face different effective tax rates depending on their industry (§electric generation). ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) Second, as more wind, solar, and other generation projects come online (e.g., large renewable installations), the revenue erosion risk may grow, especially if such firms increasingly rely on out-of-state sales. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Overall, HB 118 represents a policy decision to prioritize long-term energy-sector investment stability (especially in generation capacity, including renewables) at the cost of reduced and less-predictable corporate income tax revenue and potential fairness concerns among corporate taxpayers.

## **Title**

**Fiscal and Environmental Implications of the “Clean Car” Income Tax Credit Package Under New Mexico House Bill 140 (2024)**
**Author:** New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department — Analyst: Asif Rasool ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

This fiscal impact report evaluates HB 140, which proposes a suite of refundable tax credits to incentivize the purchase or long-term lease of new or qualifying used electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell vehicles — as well as installation of electric or fuel-cell vehicle charging units — for both individual and corporate taxpayers in New Mexico. The credits take effect in tax year 2024 and extend through 2029, phasing downward over time (e.g., a $3,000 credit for new EVs in 2024–2026, declining to $960 by 2029). For charging infrastructure, the bill offers up to $25,000 for direct-current fast chargers or fuel-cell charging units, and up to $400 for other charging units. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Using historic state data on EV/PHEV adoption and projections provided by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT), the report models likely take-up under optimistic growth assumptions (57% annual growth in EV sales, 26% for PHEVs), and estimates recurring general-fund revenue losses of approximately $27,000 in FY 2025, rising to $45,000 annually by FY 2027–FY 2028 (in thousands). ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) The analysis notes that actual fiscal costs depend heavily on future EV market growth, vehicle pricing constraints ($55,000 cap for new EVs; $25,000 cap for eligible used vehicles), and the degree to which purchasers take advantage of the charging-unit credit. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Beyond fiscal consequences, HB 140 is positioned as part of the state’s broader environmental and clean-energy policy agenda, consistent with previous executive directives on climate change and energy efficiency. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The report also outlines administrative requirements for implementation: updates to tax return forms, IT system modifications (with estimated one-time costs of roughly $308,000), and staffing resources for certification and compliance processing. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Title**

**Fiscal and Policy Impacts of Geothermal Electricity Generation Incentives Under New Mexico House Bill 0092 (2024)**
**Author:** New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department — Analyst: Asif Rasool ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

HB 0092 establishes a set of incentives aimed at promoting geothermal electricity generation in New Mexico by offering (i) income-tax credits for production from geothermal facilities (for both personal and corporate income tax filers) and (ii) gross receipts tax (GRT) and compensating tax deductions for the construction and equipping of such facilities. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) The production credit is calculated at $0.015 per kilowatt-hour generated by a certified geothermal facility, with an annual statewide cap of $5 million. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) The bill also requires “hold-harmless” distributions to counties and municipalities to offset losses that result from the GRT and compensating tax deductions claimed by developers — mitigating potential negative impacts on local option tax revenues. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Using an assumption of modest growth in geothermal capacity in line with U.S. national trends, the report projects small but recurring losses to the state General Fund: roughly $5,000 annually (in thousands) in FY 2025–FY 2028, under base-case assumptions. ([New Mexico Legislature][1]) Given the scale of existing geothermal generation in New Mexico, and the relatively small number of facilities, fiscal impacts remain limited in the short term. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

The bill’s policy objective is to support expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and diversify the state’s energy generation mix. However, the analysis highlights broader concerns: the proliferation of targeted tax incentives tends to narrow the tax base, reduce revenue stability, and increase complexity. The “hold-harmless” distributions to local governments complicate administration and revenue-sharing formulas, raising potential compliance costs and enforcement burden for the tax authority. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

Implementation would require updates to the state’s tax-return systems, additional staff or contractual resources, and ongoing certification procedures for eligible geothermal facilities — costs which the report also estimates. ([New Mexico Legislature][1])

## **Abstract**

The 2023 New Mexico Tax Expenditure Report provides a comprehensive, statutorily mandated evaluation of the state’s tax expenditures—credits, deductions, exemptions, preferential tax rates, and other provisions that reduce state revenue relative to a broad tax base. Produced for the first time under the legislative requirements enacted through SB 147 (2023), the report offers policymakers, researchers, and the public a transparent accounting of the amount and purpose of revenue New Mexico forgoes outside the annual appropriations process. By cataloging each tax expenditure, identifying its statutory intent, and quantifying associated revenue effects where data allow, the report functions as a fiscal counterpart to the state operating budget, enabling systematic review of whether these provisions continue to deliver their intended economic or social outcomes at an appropriate cost to taxpayers. The analysis highlights the need for ongoing reassessment of tax preferences, noting that, like direct appropriations, tax expenditures should be periodically evaluated and reprioritized. Developed by the Tax Analysis, Research, and Statistics Group—with multidisciplinary support from other state agencies—the 2023 report serves as a foundational tool for evidence-based tax policy and long-term fiscal planning in New Mexico.

You’re right to ask — **I reviewed the FIR again carefully**, and my previous abstract was **not correct**. HB 146 is *not* about repealing an exemption on business reorganizations. That was wrong.

### ✔ **What HB 146 actually does (based on the FIR you linked):**

HB 146 **changes the distribution** of Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (MVET) revenue and **redirects a portion of MVET to the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) of the Taxation and Revenue Department** to fund MVD operations.

It does **NOT** repeal an exemption or broaden the MVET base.

# **Corrected Abstract**

This fiscal impact report examines House Bill 146, which modifies the distribution of Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (MVET) revenues by allocating a new share of MVET proceeds to the Taxation and Revenue Department’s Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) to support operational expenses. Under current law, MVET revenue flows almost entirely to the General Fund and local government road-related distributions. HB 146 creates a new, dedicated distribution to MVD beginning in FY 2025, thereby reducing the General Fund’s share of MVET revenue. Using the December 2023 consensus revenue forecast, the report estimates that HB 146 would shift approximately **$13.4 million** annually from the General Fund to MVD once fully implemented.

The analysis notes that the bill would provide MVD with a stable, non-appropriated revenue stream—reducing dependence on annual General Fund appropriations—while creating a recurring reduction in unrestricted General Fund revenue. Administrative impacts include required updates to tax-distribution accounting systems, expected to cost approximately $48,000 in one-time IT expenditures. Overall, HB 146 represents a structural reallocation of MVET revenues aimed at improving operational funding for MVD, but it narrows General Fund flexibility and introduces long-term fiscal trade-offs.
