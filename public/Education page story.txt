# **My Learning Story (Told in Metaphors)**

When I look back at my education, it feels like flipping through the chapters of a long, colorful book. Each chapter has its own setting, its own characters, and its own lessons. Some pages were smooth, others were smudged with crossed-out ideas and late-night reworks, but together they form the story of how I became the thinker I am today.

The first chapter begins at North South University in Dhaka. I entered that campus like someone stepping into a huge library for the first time, not sure where to start but excited by the possibilities. My classes in finance, accounting, economics, and math felt like learning the alphabets of a new language. I didn’t have a map or a big plan. I simply followed my curiosity, trying to understand why companies make certain choices and how markets rise and fall like tides. Dhaka was loud and fast, but in the middle of all that noise, I learned discipline and teamwork, the way a young plant learns to grow strong even in busy soil.

Growing up in a developing country, education often felt like a ticket to survival. Everyone focused on job security, not passion. At the time, engineering was losing its shine, and business studies had become the trend. I chose it almost casually, without knowing what it would unlock for me later. Looking back now, I smile at how life works. As Forrest Gump said, life is a box of chocolates, and I happened to pick a sweet one.

The next chapter took me to the Institute of Business Administration at the University of Dhaka. If my undergraduate years were about learning the alphabet, my MBA felt like learning to write full sentences. Every class offered a new way to see decisions, risks, and leadership. It was like someone handed me a better pair of glasses. Suddenly, things I had seen before looked sharper. I understood not just the numbers but the stories behind them, the way a musician begins to hear the meaning behind the notes instead of just the melody.

Then the scenery changed completely. My move to Utah State University for my master’s degree felt like planting myself in new soil. Everything was different — the weather, the culture, even the silence. But it was in this quiet place that I learned to work deeply with data. I treated datasets the way a mechanic treats an engine, taking them apart piece by piece to see what was happening inside. Some days, the numbers cooperated. Other days, they behaved like stubborn puzzle pieces that refused to fit. Slowly, I learned patience and the art of asking the right questions. This was the chapter where I realized I enjoyed solving problems that did not have immediate answers.

My PhD at Penn State became the longest and most demanding chapter, the kind where the main character gets lost in a maze only to walk out with a deeper understanding of the world. A doctoral journey is exactly that — a maze. You turn corners, run into dead ends, redraw your map, and keep walking. Models break, arguments fall apart, and experiments refuse to behave. But every setback sharpens you. By the time I defended my dissertation, I felt like someone who had learned to navigate fog. Even when I couldn’t see the whole path, I had learned to trust the next step.

After finishing the PhD, the story could have ended there. But there was another chapter waiting. I joined the Georgia Tech Online Master’s in Computer Science, and it felt like discovering a new room in a house I thought I already knew well. Studying computer science while working full time was like juggling two torches, but it lit up parts of my mind that had been quiet for years. Human Computer Interaction opened my eyes to how people actually think and behave when using technology. And the upcoming courses in AI and machine learning feel like learning a new craft, one that blends creativity, logic, and curiosity.

Looking at these chapters together, I see more than degrees. I see growth. Each stage gave me a new lens, like collecting tools on a long journey. Business taught me how people and organizations move. Economics taught me how to trace patterns hidden beneath the surface. Research taught me to sit with difficult questions. Computer science is teaching me to build things that never existed before.

If I had to describe my education in one simple metaphor, it would be this:
It has been a long walk through different landscapes. Some were cities, some were mountains, some were quiet fields. But with every landscape, I picked up something that helped me walk further.

And the best part is, I am still walking.
